### UI Testing:

We test our application with Karma and Jasemine [Karma and Jasemine](https://angular.io/guide/testing).  

### Statistics:

For data visualization and statistics, we rely on Chart.js [Charts.js](https://www.chartjs.org/). This library supports us to create engaging charts and graphs, providing valuable insights into our data.


## Installation

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.2.7.

### Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

### Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

### Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

### Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
